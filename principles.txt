- Final user high-level library should be simple to use
- UI for pokemon without forms shouldn't have to interact with multiple options operations if not needed
    - Multiple forms, multiple evolutions, multiple megas, multiple preevolutions
    - Validation should exist to ensure no issues here
- Proper validation of read-in data, but overrideable if desired by user
    - E.g. IVs limited to 0-15 ints
- Default logic wherever possible
- No reinventing the wheel: Implement reusable basic structures where possible
    - Default strategies for battles
    - Defaults for each PVP league
    - Average out simulations based on move options if no movesets are specified
    - Default levels/stats/etc for different battle types
- Proper abstraction:
    - Pokemon mappers should not care about underlying data structures
    - Simulators should not care about math on how stats work
    - Stat math should not care about specific pokemon
